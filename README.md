## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 2000 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Getting Started With Git and GitHub
------------
Milestones of milestones of milestones. In other words:

- Open up a text editor.
- Type "Hello World".
- Save this file.
  - You have now created a "milestone" on your hard drive of this text.
	- You can now retreive that milestone by double clicking it to re-open it in your text editor.
	- This should be a concept you already understand quite well.
- Change the contents of that file again. Add in your own text. Save it again.
	- By saving it again you've overwritten the previous milestone.
	- You can certainly redo the work (e.g. replacing all the text with "Hello World" and saving again) but the original work is gone otherwise.
- Git saves milestones of milestones.

		git commit -am "By typing this command I am saving a collection of saved files."

- This is great because now we can roll back to old versions of files without having to retype. Aka "source control".
- However, wouldn't it be great if we could further save milestones in the cloud?
	- Aka milestones of milestones of milestones.
		- Github -> Git -> Save
- Github is two things:
	- git, in the cloud
	- a social network around source code
- All you need to do to push to Github:

		git push origin master

- Now one could "clone" that repository on another computer and not just get the latest code but the complete revision history on another computer.
