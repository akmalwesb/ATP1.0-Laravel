## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Getting Started With Laravel

Things that you need to install on your device:

- Git
    (https://git-scm.com/download/win)

- Node.js
    (https://nodejs.org/en/download)

- Composer
    (https://getcomposer.org/download/)

- XAMPP 
    (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

Milestones of milestones of milestones. In other words:

1. Click on the "Code" button, which is located near the top-right corner of the repository page.
2. In the dropdown menu that appears, click on the "HTTPS" option to view the repository's HTTPS URL.
3. Copy the HTTPS URL by clicking on the "Copy" button next to it.
4. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
5. Enter the following command in your terminal or command prompt, replacing <repository-URL> with the HTTPS URL that you copied in step 5:

		git clone <repository-URL>

This will clone the repository to your local machine.

Depending on the size of the repository, the cloning process may take some time. Once it is complete, you should see a message indicating that the repository has been cloned successfully.

Now you can navigate to the cloned repository on your local machine and start working on it. You can use a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to edit the files in the repository.

That's it! You have successfully cloned a repository from GitHub and have a local copy of the repository on your machine.
